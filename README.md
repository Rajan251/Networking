## Network Architecture

This section provides an overview of the network architecture used in the project. It includes information on how the system components communicate, the roles of each network device (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), and the overall topology.

- **Network Topology:** A description of how devices and servers are interconnected within the network.
- **Key Devices and Servers:** List of devices (e.g., servers, routers) with their roles and IP addresses.

## Configuration Files

Network configuration files are essential for setting up network interfaces, routing, DNS, DHCP, etc. Below are key configuration files involved in the project:

- **/etc/network/interfaces:** Configuration for network interfaces on Linux-based systems.
- **/etc/hosts:** DNS resolution configuration.
- **/etc/iptables.conf:** Firewall and routing rules.

### Example Configuration Snippet:

```bash
# Sample network interface configuration
iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1
